# Project Structure Explanation

This document provides an overview of the key files and directories in the FieldOps project.

## Root Directory

-   `.env`: Stores environment variables for configuration (e.g., database credentials, JWT secret). This file is not version controlled.
-   `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for the project.
-   `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the services, networks, and volumes for the Dockerized environment, including the PostgreSQL database.
-   `README.md`: The main documentation file for the project, providing an overview, features, and setup instructions.
-   `startup.md`: A dedicated file with concise instructions for starting the application.
-   `explanation.md`: This file, which explains the project structure.
-   `alembic.ini`: Configuration file for Alembic, the database migration tool.
-   `migrations/`: Directory containing the database migration scripts generated by Alembic.

## `app/`

This directory contains the main source code for the FastAPI application.

-   `main.py`: The entry point for the application. It initializes the FastAPI app and includes the API routers.

### `app/core/`

-   `config.py`: Handles application configuration, loading settings from environment variables.
-   `security.py`: Contains functions for password hashing, JWT creation, and verification.

### `app/db/`

-   `session.py`: Manages the database session, providing a dependency to get a database session in the API endpoints.
-   `base.py`: Contains the base class for the SQLAlchemy models and is used to initialize the database.

### `app/models/`

This directory contains the SQLAlchemy ORM models, which define the structure of the database tables.

-   `user.py`: `User` model.
-   `service_request.py`: `ServiceRequest` model.
-   `task.py`: `Task` model.
-   `rating.py`: `Rating` model.

### `app/schemas/`

This directory contains the Pydantic schemas, which are used for data validation, serialization, and documentation.

-   `user.py`: Schemas for user creation, update, and response.
-   `service_request.py`: Schemas for service requests.
-   `task.py`: Schemas for tasks.
-   `rating.py`: Schemas for ratings.
-   `token.py`: Schema for the JWT token.

### `app/api/`

-   `deps.py`: Contains dependencies for the API, such as getting the current user from a JWT.

### `app/api/v1/`

This directory contains the version 1 of the API.

-   `api.py`: The main router for the v1 API, which includes all the endpoint routers.
-   `endpoints/`: This directory contains the API endpoints for different resources.
    -   `auth.py`: Authentication endpoints (register, login).
    -   `admin.py`: Endpoints for admin-specific actions.
    -   `requests.py`: Endpoints for managing service requests.
    -   `tasks.py`: Endpoints for managing tasks.
    -   `dashboards.py`: Endpoints for the dashboards.

### `app/crud/`

This directory contains the functions for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the database models. This helps to separate the business logic from the API layer.

-   `user.py`: CRUD functions for the `User` model.
-   `service_request.py`: CRUD functions for the `ServiceRequest` model.
-   `task.py`: CRUD functions for the `Task` model.

## `tests/`

This directory contains the tests for the application.

-   `conftest.py`: Contains fixtures for Pytest.
-   `test_api/`: Contains tests for the API endpoints.
